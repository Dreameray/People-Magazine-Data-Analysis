# People-Magazine-Data-Analysis
This is a data analysis project analyzing demographics of celebrities on the People Magazine covers between 2014-2022. 

The data table was created after looking at 350 covers having 480 individuals. Project covers both semiotic and textual content analysis.

The created table was cleaned using Python to find 350 unique covers. This is due to original table having 480 rows because of some covers having multiple persons. 

R language was used to show the percentages and ggplots to comprehend and compare data easily.

Outcome was converted into an infographic.
